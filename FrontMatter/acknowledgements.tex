I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Luca Vigan√≥ for his steady guidance and support throughout the different phases of the project, and his constant availability.
His expertise and supervision helped me adjust my expectations and focus my energy on what was important in the making of a successful project.\newline

I would also like to thank my sister Maria, without whom, I could have not been so successful in my degree.
