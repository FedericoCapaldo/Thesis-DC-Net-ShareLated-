\chapter{Professional Issues}
This chapter briefly addresses the issues regarding legal, social and ethical issues that arise from the development of this project. \newline

A fully functioning implementation of the of Dining Cryptographers protocol \textit{can} have a strong impact both legally and socially, due to implications of the existence of a working protocol with unconditional untraceability. However, the software implemented in this project is a simulation of the protocol devised for learning purposes. Despite the software mirrors the internal components of a DC-Net closely, it does not address a number of fundamental issues such as the trust problem that arises from the presence of a server, or the key exchange problem at a protocol level, here solved with SSL. Therefore there are no implication legally, socially or ethically.
