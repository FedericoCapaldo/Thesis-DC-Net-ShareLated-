\chapter{Requirements and Specifications} \label{chapter:requirements}

Following an examination of the working of the Dining Cryptographers protocol, this section focuses on describing the deliverables of the DC-Net simulation. 

Firstly, the requirements to be achieved are presented. They are divided in basic requirements, i.e. the minimum requirements for an acceptable project, and advanced requirements, that instead address the more elaborated technical challenges of the protocol and limitations. In each of these two set of requirements I include a series of functional, non-functional, and security requirements. 

Lastly, the specifications section will explains how each requirement will be implemented.

\section{Brief}
The simulation will be a real-time web-based application that resembles the dynamics of the Dining Cryptographers. The simulation also attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original protocol to preserve untraceability. The website will employ a client-server architecture, with a central DC-Net service . The key-sharing graph topology employed to create a relationship of adjacency among clients is the ring topology.

These design choices will be justified in the design section (chapter \ref{chapter:design}).

\section{Requirements} \label{sec:requirements}
The requirements section, first, informally introduces what the software is going to accomplish, then, it formally lists the results that the simulation is expected to achieve.

\subsection{Basic Requirements}
The basic requirements encompass the necessary features to perform a single round of communication with the only three participants.

\subsubsection{Informal description of the basic protocol at work}
The scenario pictures a server listening to incoming connections. A new client reaches the simulation platform through his computer's browser. When a client connects to the server, the server communicates to all participants the presence of a new user, and when the number of connected nodes is exactly three, the protocol is executed. Further incoming connections are rejected, as the basic protocol acknowledges only three clients. The execution of the protocol entails the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The DC-Net Service (the server) generates adjacencies based on the list of connected clients.
    \item The DC-Net Service generates a secret key for each adjacency, and it shares every key with the relevant pair of clients belonging to an adjacency over a secure channel;
    \item Each client chooses whether he wants to send a message (i.e. flip his response). Once a client provides his answer, the secret keys and answer are XORed together and the result is sent back to the server;
    \item When the server detects that all the clients responses have been received, the final result is computed by XORing these values. The outcome is then broadcasted back to all users (recipient anonymity);
\end{enumerate}

The simulation ends after step four. If throughout the steps mentioned one of the users disconnects, the server halts the protocol execution immediately and this is communicated to the users still in the network. This happens because, as explored in the literature review, anonymity cannot be guaranteed with only two participants.

From this description of how the basic simulation works, I extracted the following lists of basic requirements.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
Functional requirements describe the actual features to be implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item BFUN1 - Allow a user to connect to the DC-Net Service (the server);
    \item BFUN2 - Enable real-time communication among clients and server;
    \item BFUN3 - Inform connected participants when another client joins the network;
    \item BFUN4 - Support exactly the connection of three clients to the DC-Net Service;
    \item BFUN5 - Prompt server to start the protocol execution as soon as three clients are connected;
    \item BFUN6 - Create adjacencies between each pair of neighbouring clients;
    \item BFUN7 - Create a secret key for each adjacency and ensure both clients receive it;
    \item BFUN8 - Allow a client to express their intention of sending a message/flipping their one-bit key;
    \item BFUN9 - Implement the XOR function on the client-side to generate the round response to be sent to server;
    \item BFUN10 - Implement the XOR function on the server-side to generate the final round result;
    \item BFUN11 - Enable server to broadcast the final round result of the protocol execution to all clients;
    \item BFUN12 - If less than three users are connected to the network, inform each participant how many nodes are currently in the network;
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-functional requirements are non-technical attributes of the system that are important for the usability of the software: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item BNFUN1 - Enable the user to understand what is happening at each stage of the protocol with clear messages;
    \item BNFUN2 - Support at least one modern browser;
    \item BNFUN3 - Deploy the system online to allow remote connections like a real distributed application;
    \item BNFUN4 - Distinguish clients between one another with unique names for usability;
    \item BNFUN5 - Slow down the the protocol execution to allow users to understand what is happening in the simulation;
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
As this is a security protocol it is essential to formalize the necessary security goals to be achieved in this separate section:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item BSEC1 - Implement the key generation process on the centralized DC-Net in a cryptographically secure manner;
    \item BSEC2 - Implement the key exchange over a secure communication channel;
    \item BSEC3 - Abort communication if less than three participants are present;
    \item BSEC4 - Ensure that cryptographers respond to the server with a message that is the XOR of its keys and his message, rather than the message in plain text (so as to enforce sender anonymity);
    \item BSEC5 - Ensure that server employs broadcast/multicast events as often as possible. If unicast messages are used, guarantee that untraceability is not compromised;
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advanced Requirements} \label{sec:advancedReq}
The advanced requirements propose possible solutions to some of the limitations of Chaum's basic protocol. Unless addressed, these issues prevent the DC-Net to be applied to a real-world scenario. The final version of the simulation departs from the three-cryptographer one-bit key design. \newline

\subsubsection{Informal description of the advanced protocol at work}
I propose the following advanced features: an arbitrary number of participants in the network, consecutive communication rounds and multiple-bit keys, message collision detection. \newline

\textbf{Arbitrary number of participants:} the protocol can be executed with any number of clients in the network, as long as the minimum number of three clients is present. The protocol execution starts with the generation of adjacencies and the key generation for each of them. Therefore, a participant that connects after the beginning of a round has to wait the end of current execution before participating in the communication. In the advent of a participant disconnection during the protocol, as long as at least three participants are still connected, the system implemented is resilient enough to complete the round. \newline

\textbf{Longer messages:} the simulation does not terminate after the execution of a single round, but it keeps repeating itself as long as three participants are connected. Moreover, longer secret keys are used. This implies that the possible key values are random numbers in the range that the key length allows, e.g. 8-bit keys have a range of 0 to 255. Thus, a participant intending to send a message, can XOR his two secret keys with a number in the same range as the keys. In other words, the message that a participant can XOR with his secret keys is no longer just 0 or 1, but it can be a larger chosen number, as long as it is smaller than the largest possible key value. 

The concept of longer keys allows the interpretation of a round message as an ASCII code. This is my own proposal that will be presented in chapter \ref{chapter:design}. For now, it is enough to know that ASCII encoding is a technique employed in the final implementation to convert a numerical round result into a letter. \newline

\textbf{Collision detection:} Collisions can happen during a single round if multiple participants try to send a message concurrently. And it can also happen across rounds, if a participant would like to send a sentence, one character per round, across multiple rounds. Both cases are addressed.

To spot and prevent collisions in a single round, the server stores the keys generated in each round for all participants. When the server receives the round message of a participant, this is compared against the XOR of the two stored key. This comparison reveals if a participant is trying to send a message. Therefore, the quickest to provide his reply has his message accepted for this round. Otherwise, the participants who attempted to send a message in vain will be notified, at the end of the round, that their message was rejected. 

To prevent collisions across multiple rounds the communication is divided into different types of rounds: voting, length-calculation, and communication rounds. Firstly, participants express their interest in sending a message during the voting round. Only one participant can win per voting round and the others will receive a 'message rejection' notification. During the length-calculation round the message sender provides the desired sentence, which will then be distributed one character a time in a number of communication rounds. These three phases rerun in the same order continuously. A message sender is not be allowed to win the following voting round, so as to prevent a user to hog the channel of communication. The specifics of these three types of rounds and the message rejection feature, which has some weighty consequences on the protocol, are both explored in more details in chapter \ref{chapter:design}.


\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item AFUN1 - Support an arbitrary number of participants in the network (instead of just three);
    \item AFUN2 - Repeat rounds of communication continuously;
    \item AFUN3 - Implement longer secret keys;
    \item AFUN4 - Detect multiple senders in the same round to avoid message collisions;
    \item AFUN5 - Divide communication into three types of rounds: voting, length-calculation, communication rounds (explained in the section \ref{sec:threeRoundTypes});
    \item AFUN6 - Reject clients that did not win the voting round to avoid message collisions in communication rounds;
    \item AFUN7 - Allow user that won the voting round (i.e. message sender) three attempts to provide their own text message in the length-calculation round;
    \item AFUN8 - Enable secret keys generation in bulk on the DC-Net server based on the result of length-calculation round;
    \item AFUN9 - Convert each letter of the message provided by the message sender into the corresponding ASCII characters;
    \item AFUN10 - At the termination of communication rounds, display the aggregate message that the user received;
    \item AFUN11 - Prevent the message sender to win the next voting round, so as to ensure a degree of fairness in the network usage;
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ANFUN1 - Increase user-friendliness with some front-end functionalities that empower the user in his learning experience;
    \item ANFUN2 - Allow longer and different types of time intervals between the various stages of communication to ensure that the simulation is understandable;
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
In addition to the basic security requirements. The following will also be necessary:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ASEC1 - Keep track of participants secret keys on the DC-Net server in order to detect collisions throughout the upcoming communication rounds;
    \item ASEC2 - Abort communication when the message sender disconnects from the network;
    \item ASEC3 - Abort communication if all participants try to send a message in the same round;
    \item ASEC4 - Synchronize clients' responses for the length-calculation round to avoid the uncovering of the message sender;
    \item ASEC5 - Implement a three-digit key range (100-999) for the length-calculation round to ensure hiding of message length (otherwise message sender would be easily spotted if all generated keys were close to 0 and shorter than the message length).
\end{enumerate}
